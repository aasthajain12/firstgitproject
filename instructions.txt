#####1. Project objective#####
Deep Learning Algorithm for Seismic Inversion

Seismic Inversion is one of the most Time and Resource intensive step of Hydrocarbon-Exploration. This project is aimed towards automation of the same, using Deep-Learning algorithms.
We expect that you will learn about seismic-inversion and develop an algorithm for the same. 
Data for the same can be accessed from Equinor-Data-Portal (Volve-field)


####2. Report submission#####
On Sunday 28 June, you have to submit milestones for project development along with justified timeline for entire Internship-period.
You will have to submit a detailed project development report as well as a brief report(in not more than 10 sentences) twice a week(every Saturday and Wednesday).

####3. Channel of communication####
Before submission of Milestones and corresponding timelines, email will be the only means of communication(a single thread of conversation should be maintained for all communications via email).
After submission of timelines, we will be collaborating on github, and discussion threads will be maintained there for query resolution.
Kindly share your github-username.

####4. Project hosting####
You will be invited to a dedicated github repository for this project.
Useful queries will be resolved on discussion threads of the github repository.
You are expected to push daily changes to the repository.
Project development report as mentioned above should be pushed to repository on every saturday and wednesday. 
No part of this project should be made public.
We expect full dedication, and prompt reply of emails/queries.
